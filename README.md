-small error occured in my video capture where it wasn't capturing my full screen. Majority of what I show is visibile. However when going over fonts it was off screen. To see how font files were connected, first open up the vendor folder and then open the fonts folder. This is where you will see the two downloaded files from google. These are then connected to the fonts.css file. Added a webpack to stop working off local host.
